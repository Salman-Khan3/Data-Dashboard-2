# Data-Dashboard-2
# Web Development Project 6 - *#Data-Dashboard-2*

Submitted by: **Salman Khan**

This web app: **The GIF shows a Marvel-themed data dashboard that dynamically updates as a user types in the search bar. The title "Marvel Characters Dashboard" is displayed prominently at the top in green text. Below it, there’s a search field where the user is typing, and as they do so, the displayed character data updates in real time. 

Two key statistics appear below the search bar: "Total Characters" and "Average Comic Appearances," which change according to the search filter. A bar chart beneath these stats shows different Marvel characters along the x-axis and their comic appearances on the y-axis. Bars animate to reflect the updated data as the search query changes, creating a responsive, interactive effect. The design uses a dark background with vibrant turquoise bars and white text for easy readability.**

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total
